# The statistical tests t-test, ANOVA, and chi-square are used in different situations, depending on the type of data and what you want to compare: 

### T-test
Used to compare the means of two samples. For example, you might use a t-test to compare the average heights of men and women. 

### ANOVA
Used to compare the means of three or more samples. ANOVA is especially useful when you want to compare multiple predictor variables at once. For example, you might use ANOVA to compare different recipes for a medication. 

### Chi-square
Used to compare categorical variables. For example, you might use a chi-square test to estimate how well a logistic regression model fits data. In this case, the chi-square test compares the predicted probabilities of purchase from the model to the actual observed outcomes. 

These tests are often used in linear regression. T-tests help determine which predictors to include, ANOVA evaluates the significance of the model, and chi-square tests ensure the model fits the data well.
